## Analysis

The persistent `supabaseUrl is required` error is caused by the `.env` file being manually created/edited, which conflicts with Lovable Cloud's auto-managed environment variables. The `.env` file is listed as a file that should **NEVER be edited manually** — it is auto-generated by the platform.

## Plan

1. **Delete the manually created `.env` file** — This file is auto-managed by Lovable Cloud. Manual versions can shadow or conflict with the platform-injected values.

2. **Update `vite.config.ts`** with a new rebuild trigger comment to force a fresh build.

3. **Update `src/main.tsx`** with a new comment to ensure HMR picks up the change.

These three changes together will clear the stale build state and let the platform's auto-injected environment variables take effect.
